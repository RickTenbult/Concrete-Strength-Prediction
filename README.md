# Concrete-Strength-Prediction

## Context
Concrete is one of the most important materials in civil engineering. The concrete compressive strength is a strong non-linear relationship between age and different materials. Concrete is a material with high strength in compression, but low strength in tension. Because of that, engineers use reinforced concrete to differint building purposes. For example, the strength of concrete used for residential buildings should not be lower than 2500 psi, which corresponds to 17 MPa.

The dataset contains 1030 instances and 9 attributes, of which 8 are quantitative input variables and 1 quantitative output variable. Furthermore, the dataset contains no missing values and is in raw form.

## Content
The feature set includes:
* Cement: quantitative input variable - kg in m3 mixture.
* Blast Furnace Slag: quantitative input variable - kg in m3 mixture.
* Fly Ash: quantitative input variable - kg in m3 mixture.
* Water: quantitative input variable - kg in m3 mixture.
* Superplasticizer: quantitative input variable - kg in m3 mixture.
* Coarse Aggregate: quantitative input variable - kg in m3 mixture.
* Fine Aggregate: quantitative input variable - kg in m3 mixture.
* Age: quantitative input variable - day (1~365).
* Strength: quantitative output variable - MPa.
