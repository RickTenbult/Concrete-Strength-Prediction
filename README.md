# Concrete-Strength-Prediction
## Context
Predicting the strength of concrete with data is highly beneficial as it allows engineers and construction professionals to accurately assess the structural integrity of a building or infrastructure project. By analyzing data related to concrete composition, curing conditions, and environmental factors, predictions can help optimize material usage, reduce costs, and ensure the safety and durability of the structure, ultimately leading to more efficient and sustainable construction practices.

The dataset contains 1030 instances and 9 attributes, of which 8 are quantitative input variables and 1 quantitative output variable. Furthermore, the dataset contains no missing values and is in raw form.

## Content
The feature set includes:
* Cement: quantitative input variable - kg in m3 mixture.
